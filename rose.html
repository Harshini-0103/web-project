        <h1>Benefites of Rosemary</h1> 
        <p>1. Enhanced Memory and Cognitive Function:
            Rosemary has a long history of use as a memory aid, and studies support its ability to improve cognitive function and potentially boost memory and learning in both young adults and older individuals according to WebMD. <br>
            2. Antioxidant and Anti-inflammatory Properties:
            Rosemary contains compounds like carnosic and rosmarinic acids, which are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. These compounds can help protect cells from damage and reduce inflammation throughout the body. <br>
            3. Stress and Anxiety Reduction:
            Preliminary research suggests that rosemary may have a positive impact on mood and cognitive function, potentially reducing stress and anxiety levels. One study indicated a reduction in anxiety and improved sleep quality in students who used rosemary oil.<br> 
            4. Potential Hair Growth Benefits:
            Rosemary oil is often used to promote hair growth and potentially combat hair loss. Its ability to improve scalp circulation and potentially inhibit DHT (a hormone linked to hair loss) may contribute to these benefits. <br>
            5. Freshens Breath:
            Rosemary's aromatic properties extend to oral health. It can be used to freshen breath and potentially combat bad breath according to Taste of Home. </p>

        <h4>Season for growing Rosemary------Rosemary can be planted in the spring after the last frost or in the fall in warm climates. It's a perennial herb, so it can be harvested throughout the year, but spring and summer are ideal for active growth and harvesting. </h4>
