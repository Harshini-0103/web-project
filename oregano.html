                <h4>Season for growing Oregano------The best time to plant oregano in Rajapalayam, Tamil Nadu, is during the cooler months, specifically autumn and winter, extending into early spring. This is because oregano thrives in warm weather but prefers moderate temperatures and good sunlight, and planting during these months allows the plants to establish roots before the intense summer heat. </h4>
